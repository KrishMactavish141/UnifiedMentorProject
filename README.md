Project Overview:
The 1st project aims to analyze health and medical data, focusing on heart disease diagnosis, to gain insights that can contribute to better future preparation and decision-making.
The Iris Classification project focuses on developing a machine learning model to accurately classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica.
Dataset Description:
The Iris dataset includes 150 samples, with 50 samples for each of the three species.
Features: Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width.
The dataset is partially linearly separable, with one species easily distinguishable, while the other two are more challenging to separate.
Significance:
The 1st project seeks to provide valuable insights into heart disease, which remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide.
By understanding the factors that contribute to heart disease, the findings can help in preventive measures and policy-making to improve public health outcomes.
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning, often used to demonstrate the performance of different classification algorithms.
